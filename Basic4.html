    <h3>Take it Easy - Travis Tritt</h3>
<p>
    <div>Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load</div>
    <span>I've got seven women on my mind:</span>
    <div>Four that wanna own me, two that wanna stone me</div>
    <span>One says she's a friend of mine</span>
    <div>Take it easy, take it easy</div>
    <span>Don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy</span>
    <div>Lighten up while you still can, don't even try to understand</div>
    <span>Just find a place to make your stand and take it easy</span>
</p>
<p>
    <div>Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona</div>
    <div>And such a fine sight to see:</div>
    <span>It's a girl, my Lord, in a flat bed Ford</span>
    <div>Slowin' down to take a look at me</div>
    <span>Come on, baby, don't say maybe</span>
    <div>I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me</div>
    <span>We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again</span>
    <span>So open up, I'm climbin' in, so take it easy</span>
</p>
<p>
    <div>Well, I'm a runnin' down the road, tryin' to loosen my load</div>
    <div>Got a world of trouble on my mind</div>
    <span>Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover</span>
    <div>She's so hard to find</div>
    <span>Take it easy, take it easy</span>
    <div>Don't let the sound of your own wheels make you crazy</div>
    <span>Come on, baby, don't say maybe</span>
    <span>I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me</span>
</p>
<p>
    <div>Oh, we got it easy</div>
    <div>We oughta take it easy</div>
